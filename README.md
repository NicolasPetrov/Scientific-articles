### 1) Java and Machine Learning: Opportunities and Limitations (scientific article)
<details> <summary><strong>Abstract (EN)</strong></summary> <p>Java, a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language, has been a cornerstone of the software development community since its introduction in the mid-1990s. With the recent release of Java 22, significant enhancements have been made that continue to increase its popularity. This research paper examines the evolution, features, architecture, and modern applications of the Java language. Understanding the impact and capabilities of Java provides insight into why it remains a cornerstone of software development, especially considering current technology trends and future growth.</p> </details>

### 2) Comparative Study of Java and Kotlin for Android Development (scientific article)
<details> <summary><strong>Abstract (EN)</strong></summary> <p>Android development has traditionally been dominated by Java, a language known for its reliability and extensive history. However, the emergence of Kotlin language created by JetBrains in 2011 and its subsequent adoption by Google as the official language for Android development in 2017 changed the situation. The main purpose of this paper is to conduct a comparative analysis of Java and Kotlin, focusing on syntax, performance, developer productivity and community acceptance, and to develop an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of both languages in the context of Android development.</p> </details>

**Keywords:** `Java` • `Kotlin` • `Android` • `syntax` • `performance` • `developer productivity`
